This project was created by @anthonysetiadi for the purposes of completing the Team Treehouse: Full Stack Javascript Course.

Unit 4 Project

This game is also hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) and can be played here https://anthonysetiadi.github.io/oop-game-v2/. 

## Objectives
The main objective of this game is to guess the hidden phrase.

This game includes 5 different phrases that need to be 'guessed' by the user. Each phrase is randomised every time the game is reset.

The user can input via two different methods:
1. On Screen Keyboard
2. Physical Keyboard

To start the game, the user simply needs to press the 'Start Game' Button or press the 'Enter' Key on their physical keyboard.

The user has 5 lives/guesses to complete the phrase before it's game over.

## Extra Credit Criteria
Styling changes include:
1. Main Font Family changed to 'Courier'
2. H2 (Phrase Hunter) heading changed to 'Impact' and 'jackInTheBox' animation added
3. When a letter is correctly guessed, the show background color was changed to green (#94d54a) instead of the default blue
